# ML Data Representation & Performance

This repository contains research code and experiments for studying how the choice of data representation affects the performance of learning algorithms. The goal is to quantitatively relate properties of a representation to generalization performance.

At this stage, all experiments and tests are collected in the Jupyter notebook:
`Number_Addition_Task.ipynb`.

For full details of the theory, setup, and results, please refer to the accompanying Overleaf manuscript:
